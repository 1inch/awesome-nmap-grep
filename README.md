# awesome-nmap-grep ðŸ’¥

A collection of awesome, _grep-like_ commands for the `nmap` greppable output
(`-oG`) format. This repository aims to serve as a quick reference to modify the
 output into readable formats.

All of the below commands assume the output was saved to a file called
`output.grep`.
